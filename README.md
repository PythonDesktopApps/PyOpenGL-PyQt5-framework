# OpenGL examples with PyOpenGL and PyQt
The OpenGL examples are based on book *"Developing Graphics Frameworks with Python and OpenGL"* by Lee Stemkoski and Michael Pascale published by CRC Press in 2021. 

I ported the examples to PyQt5.

## Running the Program
To run the program:

```
$ workon venv
(venv) $ python examples/ex2_01_empty_window.py
```

Note that the root is added to path to easily run the examples.
